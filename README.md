# ActCR



Circadian rhythms are rhythms that oscillate about every 24 h, which has been observed in multiple physiological processes including core
body temperature, hormone secretion, heart rate, blood pressure, and many others. Measuring circadian rhythm with wearables is based on a principle that there is increased movement during wake periods and reduced movement during sleep periods, and has been shown to be reliable and valid.
